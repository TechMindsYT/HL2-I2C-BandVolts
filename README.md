# HL2-I2C-BandVolts

Bandvolt interface for between the Hermes Lite 2 and the Xiegu XPA125B amplifier.

Allows the Hermes Lite 2 to control the band selection on the XPA125B.

Watch the YouTube video for more information.

While I could of used just one Arduino and then used a digital PWM pin, with a low pass filter for the Bandvolt DC, I wanted to use other I2C devices on the second Arduino.

Two .ino files for each Arduino.
